@section lin stack LIN STACK
  The current driver version is 2.1.0.

  - 2.1.0
 	- Bug Fixes
 	  - Fixed bug that for lin slave once break field is detected before completing the last frame no error status is
        raised, by adding enum LIN_LAST_RESPONSE_SHORT_ERROR to protocol specification and adding
        LIN_LLD_LAST_RESPONSE_SHORT_ERR to low level event id, and once last frame too shorted is detected response
        error is raised.
      - Fixed bug that for LIN2.1, the response error signal is not updated once error is detected in slave node.
      - Fixed bug that when frame ID is 0x3D the PID should be 0x7D rather than 0x3D.

  - 2.0.0
    - Initial version.
